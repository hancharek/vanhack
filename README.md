# Events Page

## About the Project

VanHack is a network of the world’s top software engineering, design, and digital marketing talent. For the tests of proficience they apply challenges through HackerRank platform in order to verify their skills. For this challenge I needed to make a complete events page using some technologies and fullfil some requirements:

#### Functionality (65%)
- Apply to events and see confirmation of the application
- See more details of the event
- Share the event with a friend (through Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc)
- See a error warning when trying to apply for a premium only webnar.
  - This error has to show an button for the candidate to read more about premium/buy a plan
- Types of events:
  - MeetUp, Leap, Recruiting Mission, VanHackaton
  - Premium Only Webinar, Open Webinar


#### Design (35%)
 - Leap, Mission and VanHackaton events should **visually stand out**
 - Premium-only should be visually distinguished form the "open for all" webinars;
 - Should not be a copy of the VanHack current events page.
